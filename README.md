**## Hi, I’m Ethan 👋

I’m a first-year engineering student with a strong interest in **computer science, systems, and practical software engineering**. I enjoy building things that are simple, efficient, and actually useful.

---

### 🔧 What I’m currently working on
- Coursework projects in **Python, Java, and introductory systems concepts**
- Small personal projects to strengthen fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, tooling)
- Improving my problem-solving and mathematical foundations for engineering coursework

---

### 🌱 What I’m currently learning
- Data structures and algorithmic thinking  
- Core computer science concepts (memory, complexity, abstraction)
- Writing clearer, more maintainable code

---

### 🧰 Tools & technologies
- **Languages:** Java, Python (learning C/C++ concepts)
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, IntelliJ
- **Other:** Markdown, basic Linux/CLI workflows

---

### 🤝 Collaboration
I’m open to collaborating on:
- Beginner–intermediate CS projects
- Study-focused or learning-driven repos
- Small tools or utilities that solve real problems

---

### 📫 How to reach me
- GitHub: `@ethnmz`
- Email: ethan7714@tamu.edu

---

### 📌 A bit more about me
- I value **clarity over cleverness** in code  
- I prefer understanding fundamentals rather than memorizing patterns  
- Long-term goal: become a strong, well-rounded software engineer
